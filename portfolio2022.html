  <summary><b>Obedience</b></summary>
  2022. Chlorophyll print on <i>Ficus hispida</i> leaf.</br>
Using plant knowledge from my landscape architecture degree, digital collages can be exposed onto leaves.  Still, experimentation is crucial, and the absence of sunlight is a force majeure (weather forecasts cannot predict everything).  Versatile, variable, natural, ephemeral.</br>
I have done relief prints on different surfaces and mixed-media collagraphs as well.  Starting from printmaking, I have arrived at cyanotypes and cuprotypes.  In the process, I found that having an adequate understanding of chemistry is quintessential to a successful photo print, and any innovation on the photographic processes.  I have learnt about the uralotype online but never dared to try it without technical guidance.

       <summary>Long description</summary>
      <small>

Although I’ve never been in a relationship, <i>Bondage</i> is an artwork which talks about modern life, interpersonal and love relationships. I think this installation is somehow ‘world art’, as it intertwines at least Hong Kong, Japanese and Chinese traditions with aboriginal overtones.  The wind reminds me of Tibetan prayer flags.</br>
</br>
There should never be subordinate relationships between people.  Everyone can become a complete person and live their lives.  The Confucius saying ‘the ruler should rule, the minister should minister; the father should father, the son should son’ is not advocating that people should be classified into classes, but that the ruler should do what is required of a ruler, like a ruler, and everyone should be themselves.</br>
</br>
When the Japanese see two stones side by side in the sea, they call it ‘Meoto Iwa’ or ‘Married Couple Rocks’.  This kind of scenic spots are all over Japan.  It is ultimately fate which brought the two rocks together and causing them to emerge at the same place.  For couples, it should be noted that one doesn’t belong to another, and each is an independent individual.  It’s not that surprising even if I call them ‘Classmate Rocks’ or ‘Nemesis Rocks’.</br>
</br>
Respect all life, including pets, or when in employer-employee, teacher-student or parent-child relationships.</br>
</br>
I was apprised of the cancellation of an English Literature elective at a certain university recently.  The reason was that they were afraid of any potential criticism when they discuss Orwell.  Obviously Orwell is a great writer, and everyone knows him, so why are you so scared?  It seems that immersing into literature too much had damaged their heads.  If it keeps going like this, what on earth can be taught or talked about?  You should be yourself and be human.</br>
</br>
Speaking of modern life, Hong Kong’s ‘LeaveHomeSafe’ contact tracing app is really bewitching and all over the place.  Anyway, the app’s function is to drive away viruses in the four cardinal directions and ask the pandemic to recede as swiftly as possible.  This kind of function is like worshipping traditional gods and praying for blessings.  There were plagues in ancient times, and what people can do is limited.  They could only do as much as they could, and pray for heavenly blessings for the rest.</br>
</br>
I like to create artworks which incorporate local folk cultural elements.  This time, I chose one of the ‘Anti-epidemic Talismans: Dispels the epidemic and brings auspice if hung in front of the court’ in ‘The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Genesis Tripartite Talismans, Taoist Canon of the Zhengtong Reign’.  This book contains talismans for different purposes, such as protecting the body, bringing peace home, dispersing rustic earthly energy, stopping wastage, boosting the productivity of farms and silkworms, etc.  It is compiled very systematically and logically, and it can be called a practical reference book.</br>
</br>
Usually Married Couple Rocks are tied with the Shimenawa rope.  Traditionally made of hemp, the rope is used to ward off evil spirits and protect sacred and important places, such as sacred trees.  However, were the rocks asked for consent before being tied up together?  Or is it just one’s wishful thinking?  Love comes from the heart, and cannot be forced.</br>
</br>
If two entities are connected by such things, do they seem like hi-bye friends?</br>
</br>
Is one rock coercively pulled towards to another, are the rocks in opposition, or are they coexisting harmoniously?  Are they close or distant?  Are they big macho man and little lady, or big chauvinist woman and little man?  In fact, stones have no gender, and those who are coercively pulled by others can also pull oppositely.  Just like the Amah Rock, why is the rock supposed to be waiting for the husband to return? Can’t the rock wait for the wife to return?  Or waiting for a cat to return? Can it be called Monkey Rock, Cat’s Rock or Dog Rock?  Although stones are just stones, they can have different imaginative associations.  I hope to broaden everyone’s imagination of art and the future.</br>
</br>
To keep this brief, topics related to <i>Bondage</i> and rope binding, relationships, modern gardens and landscapes, forms, negative space and talismans etc will be discussed later.  Hey, but please bear in mind I’m not into ropes.</br>
</br>
I want to keep the mythical field open, and keep making art to convey hope to everyone, so that you can have something to smile about. Recently, I have been experimenting different stuff.  I hope to make good encouraging art.

  <summary><b>drifting my way home</b></summary>
  2021.09.  Guitar and storytelling performance.  1 h 30 min. Let’s Be Together Arts Festival.  Guitar, laptop, mixer, speakers, projector.</br>
It is about an unforgettable homeless experience in Australia after being robbed in Melbourne.  Broke, I had to sleep on the streets, in various public places (in the supermarket, toilet, fast-food restaurant, petrol station <i>etc</i>.) and on the train overnight.  Eventually I walked on foot and hitchhiked to Sydney to take a flight back to Hong Kong.  Poverty and hunger are basic daily problems, while microaggressions and indifference are much less of a problem.  I still upheld the traveller's carefree spirit and explored around where possible.  You must learn to adapt in this kind of environment.  Performed with SFXs and visuals. Photo courtesy of Mr CHUK Yin-man.

  <summary><b>Solargraphy project</b> (in progress)</summary>
  Spring 2022 – Present.  Photographic paper 5″ × 8″ 100pcs, crowler aluminum cans 550mL 100pcs, gaffer tape, sticky tack.</br>
Installed to photograph the Lion Rock, Victoria Harbour, PolyU, Nathan Road, YOHO Mall, Southorn Playground etc. – places throughout different regions of Hong Kong, in mostly urban and some rural areas.  I contacted local store owners supportive of art photography, family members and friends who are willing to place pinhole cans at their homes for installing personally.  I also reached out to stores I hadn’t known, located at places I wished to photograph.  Of course, quite a bunch of people have failed this trust test.  Scheduling time slots for everyone and routing the itinerary was an administrative marathon.  People of nearby locations might not be available at the same time.  I really appreciated that a local brewery had lent me a canning machine and their refrigerated warehouse as a makeshift darkroom (down jacket was worn).

  <summary>TO Fu’s poem</summary>
Chinese ‘poet saint’ TO Fu (DU Fu; 712–770) described war in his famous poem <i>Spring View</i> (757):  </br></br>
<i>The nation is broken, mountains and rivers remain.</br>
In cities in spring, grasses and trees grow deeply.</br>
Sensing the moment, flowers shed tears.  </br>
Hating the separation, birds are fearful at heart…</br></br>
Watchtower fires have burnt continuously for three months.</br>
A letter from home is worth ten thousand pieces of gold.</br>
My white hair is even scarcer from scratching.  </br>
And can barely hold a hairpin.
</i></br></br></details>

It shows how the city and current systems are out of order, having various states of misconnections and anticommunication.  These mishaps are explained by Western astrology and Chinese numerology.
