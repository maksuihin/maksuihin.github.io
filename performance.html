			The audiovisual installation performance suspends gloves as a chaotic pendulum system. The gloves wail with live electronic sounds generated by analogue accelerometers, and helplessly drip paint into frantic patterns. Their struggle shows the unpredictability and impermanence in life, and that we are all interconnected in this world. It discusses mental health and emotional response to trauma and drastic changes in living conditions.

		<li><em>solitaire music</em>
			</br>128 bullingdon road g/f project space, oxford (2024)
			</br>7-ch process art

       			</br><details><summary>performance description</summary>
			The performance mixes Mozart-Cagean game music, serialist musique concrète and video art. The spatialised multichannel audio explores polarised chromatic tensions within the socio-mystic gamut. Found sounds of propaganda and conflicts were assigned to every playing card on the tableau. It reflects on how a single person could construct justice and peace in a tumultuous world with an unknown future.
