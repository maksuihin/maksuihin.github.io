[[Start Game&gt;&gt;|Southern Palace]]

Feng shui numerology considers fate in 60-year eras, divided into 3 scores. It was traditionally described that the Year of Dragon 2024 marks the beginning of the Score of Fire (2024-2043), which may be evidenced by the increased level of conflicts, wars, social upheavals, violence, pandemics, polarisation, destruction and chaos in recent years.

In order to pray for good luck in the star-crossed Score of Fire, feng shui installations associated with the five elements are constructed and placed in the corresponding directions to harmonise or counteract malignant celestial effects.

Remember that chi is the vital force, and you should find ways to conserve, augment or replenish your own chi.

In this game, you will navigate and explore this field of installations. Notebook pages are scattered in the field and you may read them to understand more about my art practice.

Like life, the objective of the game would not be expressly announced when you were born. I imagine that you would eventually discover the meaning of the game.

I chose to submit the dissertation in the form of an interactive game because I believe that artists should not dictate the meanings of exhibited artworks, rather, art in contemporary society is a social product, where both the artists and the audience interact to (de-/re-)construct and (mis-/re-)interpret each other’s ideas. I believe that art has to be experienced. The playful presentation is to contrast with the seriousness and heaviness of the themes that run through my art practice, employed as a result of societal taboo, self censorship or political correct language to avoid offending people devoted to different cultural beliefs, consequently as a form of absurd humour.

Stay safe, stay strong, and good luck!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Southern Palace" tags="" position="950,875" size="100,100">You are at the south, outside what it seems to be the Southern Palace.
You now have ''$chi chi''.

There is a label stuck on the wall. You realise that the feng shui installation here is called 
''//Three Mishaps: Blue Rectangular Rug and Water Plant to Minimise Ominous Fire Energy//''.

From the outside, the Southern Palace appears to be a pristine white room. There is also a white door-like panel blocking the entrance. There is a notice on the wall saying //''Warning: Strobe Lights''. It might not be safe for those who has photosensitivity or epilepsy.//

A racing metronomic sound is continuously heard outside the Southern Palace.

You just have enough time to see that the interior of the Southern Palace is also as white as snow. 

But the next moment, you feel that your body is getting weaker and weaker, and you realise you don’t have enough chi to continue exploring the Southern Palace. 

You have absorbed too much ominous fire energy.

You ''have only $chi chi left''. You slowly close your eyes and collapse into unconsciousness, into oblivion. You no longer have any memory of the past.

It took you some time to adjust to the strong light, but you eventually got used to it. 

The interior of the Southern Palace is also as white as snow, just like its exterior. 

Metal wires are supending a water plant in the centre of the white Palace, and its ultramarine wire drapes down to the embers on the ground.

Orderly droplets of water escape from the water plant, banging metronomically onto the rectangular rug which houses the fiery light. It is attempting to put out the fire of the heart.

The strobe light makes the droplets appear to be going upwards cinematically against gravity.

You wonder whether the sound would change when there is a puddle, whether the tempo of the water plant actually changes, and when would the water overflow.

You are thinking if this water is the same kind of water used by military personnel in water cannons, or is this water the music of nature. You know that whatever interpretations can be deemed correct or incorrect. Is it contemplative or supposed to make you experience zen? Is it ominous? Before officials announce and interpret anything, you better suppress your biased opinion.

You observed the orderly flow of water droplet by droplet and kinda hope that the water would nourish your chi. But it does not, unfortunately.

//''Time-based media''
I have been experimenting with different media, both static 2D and 3D image-making and kinaesthetic installations to tell these narratives. Sound has always recurred throughout my art practice, as I was musically educated to be a violinist yet later also suffered hearing impairment. I believe that variations in motion and sound in time can capture the senses and attention of the audience more than static artwork. The physicality and viscerality of the artworks mean that the audience can only experience it first-hand when they are personally visiting, that any video recordings is only a partial glimpse of the timeline since the artworks are open-ended. When an artwork changes in time slowly, it may not be noticeable to the impatient. This subtlety can only be experienced by observing the artwork for a longer time or by imagination. Similarly, we cannot see the entirety of Tao. 

Working in time-based media would encourage the audience to think of the past, present and future.  Through questioning the concept of time, I also critically question (but not endorse) the radical separatist subversive secessionist phrase ‘our times’ in Hong Kong: Who is the possessive adjective referring to? What is the present? What relationships and interactions are there? What can it really achieve? 

The open-endedness of the project signifies the continuation of time, that the world wags on, that everything in the present is based on the indelible past, and that only by changing the present can we change the future.//

[[Inspect vase exterior]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="Still touch the outside of the vase" tags="" position="200,800" size="100,100">You finally decide to feel the vase on the outside, but a (text-colour:red)[''tiny piece of strange metal''] on the rotating vase surface cut some flesh off your hand. The cut made you (text-colour:red)[''lose 2 chi'']. (set: $chi to it + -2)(if:$chi &lt; 25)[

The cut was so deep that you can faintly see your bones. You look at the oozing wound with your gradually blurry eyes. You realise it is not a good idea to be sympathetic and feel others.

You feel yourself getting weaker and weaker, and you realise you don’t have enough chi to continue investigating this bloody red vase in the southwest corner. 

You have ignited too much joyful bliss. Maybe this is not the appropriate type of bliss for you.

You ''have only $chi chi left''. You slowly close your eyes and collapse into unconsciousness, into oblivion. You no longer have any memory of the past.

You perished.
Game over.
