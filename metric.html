			<h2>Water Quality Index</h2></p>
			MAK Sui Hin
			<div class="blurb">
		<p>Water quality index reflects the ability of the water to provide goods and services to the ecology and humans sustainably, based on a wide range of physical, chemical and biological parameters. Levels of ammonia, copper, mercury, microbes <i>etc.</i> are measured repetitively at different locations to determine the quality of the water body. Bioindicators like plants, molluscs and other invertebrates can be a subjective indicator of the water quality. It can be applied to virtually all landscapes where water is present. The United Nations and the World Health Organization agreed on different drinking, domestic and general water use standards.</p>
