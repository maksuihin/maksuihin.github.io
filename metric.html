			<h2>Water Quality Index</h2></p>
			MAK Sui Hin
			<div class="blurb">
		<p>Water quality index reﬂects biodiversity and whether the water can provide goods and services to the ecology and humans sustainably, based on physical, chemical and biological parameters. Temperature, turbidity, levels of ammonia, heavy metals, microbes <i>etc.</i> are measured repetitively. Bioindicators like mayﬂy and mollusc populations are susceptible to interpretation. It can be applied to virtually all landscapes where water is present. The United Nations and the World Health Organization agreed on diﬀerent drinking, domestic and general water use standards. Toxic substances and some microogranism populations render the ambient water quality poor and hazardous for swimming, ﬁshing or irrigation.</p>
