			<p><h2>browser plugins</h2></p>
			<u1>
			<li><em>text sanitizer / 文字消毒器</em>
        </br>simple browser plugin
	</br>replacing politically convoluted terms on websites  
			with its correct and accurate counterpart which makes sense. 
			you won't see convoluted terms in your browser anymore!
	</br>inspired as i found myself talking about the 'novel coronavirus pneumonia', 
an entirely fabricated lexical item obfuscating its origins and what's really going on. 
</br>(2020)
	</br>
</br>COVID -> Chinese Virus <i>etc.</i> (english)
</br>新冠 -> 中囯病毒 <i>etc.</i> (chinese)
</br>新型コロナ -> 武漢コロナ <i>etc.</i> (japanese)
</br>optional: write your own

<p><h2>scripts</h2></p>
		<u1>
		<li><em>poetry generator</em>
        </br>written during the a.i. frenzy (2016)
	</br>python command line, no GUI 
</br>[won't be released]
</br>the programme reviewed some chinese poetry and can compose new pieecs in a click. users may input seed words if wanted to. 
turing tests was conducted to collect comments and determine reliability. pieces were collect from some poet friends for the comparison test.
it is said that the programme is a little dadaist, which i sometimes agree - it is a little bit jumpy but i don't think it is a problem.
the results reviewed that the program is on average 70% human, and for some pieces, over 85% human.
</br>another poetry programme 少女诗人小冰 from 微软小冰 (xiaoice / microsoft xiaobing) went popular in mid-2017. since then,
the intention in polishing my programme perished.
