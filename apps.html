</br>inspired as i found myself saying ‘novel coronavirus pneumonia’ 新冠肺炎.
we should stop entirely fabricated lexical items obfuscating its origin and what’s really going on.

        </br>written during the a.i. frenzy 
	</br>tensorflow/keras (2016)
</br>[won’t be released]
</br>it reviewed a small corpus of contemporary chinese poems and can compose new pieces. users may input seed words if wanted to. 
turing tests was conducted to collect comments and determine reliability. pieces were collected from some poet friends for the comparison test.
it is said that the programme is a little dadaist, which i sometimes agree - it is a little bit jumpy but i don’t think it is a problem.
the results reviewed that the program is on average 70% human, and for some pieces, over 85% human.
</br>another poetry programme 少女「诗」人小冰, under 微「软」小冰 (xiaoice / microsoft xiaobing) went popular in mid-2017. since then,
the intention in polishing my poetry programme perished progressively. this study was therefore not published.
</br>-
</br>the biggest difficulty lies in the making of the corpus. <i>i originally aspired to create a programme in
	the style of contemporary hongkong local poetry.</i> as ‘producing a complete collection of local 
poetry’ is directly translatable to ‘digitizing and formatting texts from anthrologies and other different sources’, the 
difficulty to obtain and the lack of
variety in text sources would mean a biased corpus. thus it would not thoroughly represent the hongkong poetry spirit in its entirety.
</br>the biased corpus used in this project was an assortment of hongkong, taiwan, and mainland poems.
</br>i hope someone would eventually be aware and able to assist in acquiring a hongkong corpus from anthrologies or zines or so,
so that a hongkong local digital poet can truly be born someday, with its complex feelings about our land.
