				<em>麥瑞顯</em>畢業於港大園境建築，愛玩視覺、文字和音符遊戲。</br>
				近年的創作交織影像和聲音藝術，希望觀眾張開耳目，感受身邊的日常，

				<em>Mak Sui Hin</em> graduated from HKU landscape architecture. He loves playing games on 
				visuals, poetry and musical notes.</br>
				His creative outputs in recent years weave images and sound art, 
				hoping to persuade everyone to open their eyes and ears to feel 
				everyday surroundings. He wishes to guide the audience to reflect on the 
				relationship between the contemporary society, the land, and themselves, as well as 
				the meaning of living and drifting. Sometimes he also contributes to local literary zines. 
				In 2019, his experimental film “<i>tofu</i>” was screened at the British Museum.</p>
