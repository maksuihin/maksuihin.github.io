Hi all. I’m grateful to announce that my composition for a small-to-medium-sized orchestra has just reached 10 minutes. I’m still writing more, so it will be longer. Tell you what, I’ve started this a long time ago, like September last year, but since I’m kept busy with my academics, I didn’t have much time for it. I’ve tried to squeeze just enough time for it and woohoo! Now the semester has just ended yesterday! I’m so free to continue composing! I need to finish it soon and enter an international composition competition. There must be a lot of good works there. Good night and I’ll go on working on it tomorrow :)
