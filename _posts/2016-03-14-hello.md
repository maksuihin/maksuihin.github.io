Well. A manager asking if I have a personal website motivated me to make this. Finally got around to putting it together. The mid-term assignment was just over, but there are **more** to come. I need to cope with several things at the same time, hence there are not really enough time for my competition piece. I just hope there’s enough time for me to finish and submit it on time.

For now, I realized that the world hasn’t seen or heard a lot of my works. Personally I do offer my friends *.wav* files to listen to or some scores to read, but for publishing my scores or a début concert? Not yet.

I hope more people can enjoy my music.
